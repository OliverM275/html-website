<h1>Trinity University</h1>

<a href="http:/trinity.edu">Trinity University</a> is located in San Antonio, Texas. Due to its very small size Trinity has the ability to keep the
large majority of its classes at a small scale which allows students to get to know their teachers. Trinity University is filled with student 
run clubs and organizations.</p>

<p> Trinity's campus is small and well organized, it does not take that much long of time walk to buildings for each class. </p>
<p>The features about Trinity that I appreciate most are the cozy red brick buildings and our CSI building. There are plenty of places to study on campus including my favorite 
	spots in the basement of the library and the CUBE located in CSI. </p></br>

<p>I chose Trinity University because I knew what I wanted to study before picking out my colleges. I wanted to study biochemistry and decided that Trinity had the 
	best option amongst the other schools that I had gotten into. Also I was able to visit the school and met with many of the professors that teach chemistry and really enjoyed talking to them.</p>
